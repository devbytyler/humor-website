<p>Who doesn't like Humour? Humour is one of those things that makes life livable even in the hardest of times. 
It is because of Humour that we, as humans, laugh - a natural phenomenon that makes us happier, and healthier too. 
Thanks to the awesomeness of Humour, some people have dedicated their lives to making other people laugh. What a noble pursuit! 
They can accomplish this in many forms. Some examples are comics, memes, videos, stand-up comedy, movies, ventriloquism, jokes, 
skits, and really the list just goes on an on! In this website, I will give a few examples of what I find to be particularly 
funny, and hopefully you find it funny too.</p>



<h1>Memes</h1>
<p>First up are memes. Memes are like never-ending blackholes that suck you in for hours upon hours. Here are a few good examples of why. </p>
